== What's New in Spring Batch 4.1

The Spring Batch 4.1 release adds the following features:

* A new `@SpringBatchTest` annotation to simplify testing batch components
* A new `@EnableBatchIntegration` annotation to simplify remote chunking configuration
* A new `JsonItemReader` and `JsonFileItemWriter` to support the JSON format

[[whatsNewTesting]]
=== `@SpringBatchTest` Annotation

Spring Batch provides some nice utility classes (such as the `JobLauncherTestUtils` and
`JobRepositoryTestUtils`) and test execution listeners (`StepScopeTestExecutionListener`
and `JobScopeTestExecutionListener`) to test batch components. However, in order
to use these utilities, you must configure them explicitly. This release introduces
a new annotation named `@SpringBatchTest` that automatically adds utility beans and
listeners to the test context and makes them  available for autowiring,
as the following example shows:

[source, java]
----
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBatchTest
@ContextConfiguration(classes = {JobConfiguration.class})
public class JobTest {

   @Autowired
   private JobLauncherTestUtils jobLauncherTestUtils;

   @Autowired
   private JobRepositoryTestUtils jobRepositoryTestUtils;


   @Before
   public void clearMetadata() {
      jobRepositoryTestUtils.removeJobExecutions();
   }

   @Test
   public void testJob() throws Exception {
      // given
      JobParameters jobParameters =
            jobLauncherTestUtils.getUniqueJobParameters();

      // when
      JobExecution jobExecution =
            jobLauncherTestUtils.launchJob(jobParameters);

      // then
      Assert.assertEquals(ExitStatus.COMPLETED,
                          jobExecution.getExitStatus());
   }

}
----

For more details about this new annotation, see the
<<testing.adoc#creatingUnitTestClass,Unit Testing>> chapter.

[[whatsNewIntegration]]
=== `@EnableBatchIntegration` Annotation

Setting up a remote chunking job requires the definition of a number of beans:

* A connection factory to acquire connections from the messaging middleware (JMS, AMQP, and others)
* A `MessagingTemplate` to send requests from the master to the workers and back again
* An input channel and an output channel for Spring Integration to get messages from the messaging middleware
* A special item writer (`ChunkMessageChannelItemWriter`) on the master side that knows how to send chunks of data to workers for processing and writing
* A message listener (`ChunkProcessorChunkHandler`) on the worker side to receive data from the master

This can be a bit daunting at first glance. This release introduces a new annotation
named `@EnableBatchIntegration` as well as new APIs (`RemoteChunkingMasterStepBuilder`
and `RemoteChunkingWorkerBuilder`) to simplify the configuration. The following
example shows how to use the new annotation and APIs:

[source, java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableBatchProcessing
@EnableBatchIntegration
public class RemoteChunkingAppConfig {

   @Autowired
   private RemoteChunkingMasterStepBuilderFactory masterStepBuilderFactory;

   @Autowired
   private RemoteChunkingWorkerBuilder workerBuilder;

   @Bean
   public TaskletStep masterStep() {
         return this.masterStepBuilderFactory
         	        .get("masterStep")
         	        .chunk(100)
         	        .reader(itemReader())
         	        .outputChannel(outgoingRequestsToWorkers())
         	        .inputChannel(incomingRepliesFromWorkers())
         	        .build();
   }

   @Bean
   public IntegrationFlow worker() {
         return this.workerBuilder
         	        .itemProcessor(itemProcessor())
         	        .itemWriter(itemWriter())
         	        .inputChannel(incomingRequestsFromMaster())
         	        .outputChannel(outgoingRepliesToMaster())
         	        .build();
   }

   // Middleware beans setup omitted
}
----

This new annotation and builders take care of the heavy lifting of configuring
infrastructure beans. You can now easily configure a master step as well as
a Spring Integration flow on the worker side. You can find a remote chunking sample
that uses these new APIs in the
link:$$https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch/tree/master/spring-batch-samples#remote-chunking-sample$$[samples module]
as well as more details in the <<spring-batch-integration.adoc#remote-chunking,Spring Batch Integration>> chapter.

[[whatsNewJson]]
=== JSON support

Spring Batch 4.1 adds support for the JSON format. This release introduces a new
item reader that can read a JSON resource in the following format:

[source, json]
----
[
  {
    "isin": "123",
    "quantity": 1,
    "price": 1.2,
    "customer": "foo"
  },
  {
    "isin": "456",
    "quantity": 2,
    "price": 1.4,
    "customer": "bar"
  }
]
----

Similar to the `StaxEventItemReader` for XML, the new `JsonItemReader` uses streaming
APIs to read JSON objects in chunks. Spring Batch supports two libraries:

* link:$$https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson$$[Jackson]
* link:$$https://github.com/google/gson$$[Gson]

To add other libraries, you can implement the `JsonObjectReader` interface.

Writing JSON data is also supported through the `JsonFileItemWriter`.
For more details about JSON support, see the
<<readersAndWriters.adoc#jsonReadingWriting,ItemReaders and ItemWriters>> chapter.
