    <title>Java 8 Requirement</title>

    <para>Spring Batch has historically followed Spring Framework's baselines for both
		java version as well as third party dependencies.  With Spring Batch 4, the Spring
		Framework version is being upgraded to Spring Framework 5.  As such, the java
		version requirement for Spring Batch is also increasing to Java 8.
	</para>

  <section id="whatsNewDependencies">
    <title>Dependencies re-baseline</title>

    <para>In order to continue to integrate with supported versions of the third party
		libraries Spring Batch utilizes, Spring Batch 4 is updating the dependencies across
		the board.  The new dependency versions are in alignment with Spring Framework 5.
	</para>
  </section>

  <section id="whatsNewBuilders">
    <title>Provide builders for the ItemReaders and ItemWriters</title>

    <para>Spring Batch 4 is providing a collection of builders for all of the <classname>ItemReaders</classname>
		and <classname>ItemWriters</classname> that come with the framework.  As of this release, builders for the
		<classname>FlatFileItemReader</classname>, <classname>FlatFileItemWriter</classname>, <classname>JdbcCursorItemReader</classname>, and
